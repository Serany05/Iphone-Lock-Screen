Hi, Im 3 months into Html, Css and Javascript and this is what i made with the knowledge i have im self taught!
This is one of my first big projects and i would love if someone could give me some ideas for projects.
I think this was an really good training for css html and javascript and im thinking of making an App store as an project.
